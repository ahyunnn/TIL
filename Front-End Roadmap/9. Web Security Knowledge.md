### 9.1 Web Security knowledge
* Web security knowledge encompasses understanding and implementing practices to protect websites, web applications, and web services from various cyber threats. 
	1. HTTPS and TLS for secure data transmission
	2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
	3. SQL injection protection
	4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) mitigation
	5. Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
	6. Secure authentication and session management
	7. Input validation and sanitization
	8. Protection against clickjacking
	9. Secure cookie handling
	10. Regular security updates and patch management
### 9.2 HTTPS 
* HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
* the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website
* HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer 
* particularly important when users transmit sensitive data such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or insurance provider
### 9.3 CORS
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
* a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to control access to resources (like APIs or fonts) 
* works through a system of HTTP headers, where browsers send a preflight request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource and the server responds with headers indicating whether the actual request is allowed
* this mechanism helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data while enabilng legitimate cross-origin requests

### <정상 동작>
![[KakaoTalk_20250331_200223007_01.jpg]]
1. 클라이언트에서 요청 (요청의 출처(origin)이 서버와 다르면 CORS 정책이 적용)
2. Preflight Request : 브라우저는 실제 요청 전에 서버가 요청을 허용하는지 확인을 위해 OPTIONS 요청을 보냄
3. 서버의 Preflight 응답 : `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` 헤더를 포함하여 전달
4. CORS 허용된 후 실제 요청 진행
### <CORS 에러>

1. 클라이언트에서 요청
2. Preflight Request
3. 서버의 Preflight 응답 : `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` 헤더가 포함되지 않음
4. CORS 에러
### 9.4 Content Security Policy
* a security standard implemented by web browsers to prevent cross-site scripting(XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks
* works by allowing web developers to specify which sources of content are trusted and can be loaded on a web page
