	5. Performance testing : assessing app speed, responsiveness, and stability
	6. Security testing : identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring data protection
	7. Accessibility testing : verifying usability for people with disabilities

* Modern testing often incorporates automated testing tools and continuous integration/continuous deployment(CI/CD) pipelines
* Test-driven development (TDD) and Behavior-driven development (BDD) are popular methodologies that emphasize writing tests before or alongside code
