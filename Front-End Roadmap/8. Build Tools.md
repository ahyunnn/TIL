### 8.1 What is Build Tools?
* Software utilities designed to **automate the process of creating executable applications from the source code** (handle tasks such as compiling, linking, minifying and bundling code, as well as running tests and managaing dependencies)
* common build tools : Gradle, Make, Mave, Webpack, Gulp
	* these tools **streamline development workflows by reducing manual steps, ensuring consistency across different environment and optimizing output for production**
### 8.2 Linters & Formatters
* tools used in software development to improve code quality and consistency
* Linter
	* analyze src code to **detect programming errors, bugs, stylistic issues and suspicious constructs**, often enforcing a set of predefined or custom rules
* Formatter
	* automatically restructure code to **adhere to a consistent style**, adjusting elements like indentation, line breaks, and spacing
### 8.3 Module Bundlers
* Module Bundler is a development tools that combine multiple JavaScript files and their dependencies into a single file, optimized for web browsers
* resolve and manage dependencies, transfom and optimize code and often support features like code splitting and lazy loading
* common module bundlers : Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Vite
	* address challenges in managing complex JavaScript applications by organizing code into modules
	* eliminating global scope pollution
	* improving load times
