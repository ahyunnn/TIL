### 8.1 What is Build Tools?
* Software utilities designed to **automate the process of creating executable applications from the source code** (handle tasks such as compiling, linking, minifying and bundling code, as well as running tests and managaing dependencies)
* common build tools : Gradle, Make, Mave, Webpack, Gulp
	* these tools **streamline development workflows by reducing manual steps, ensuring consistency across different environment and optimizing output for production**
### 8.2 Linters & Formatters
* tools used in software development to improve code quality and consistency
* Linter
	* analyze src code to **detect programming errors, bugs, stylistic issues and suspicious constructs**, often enforcing a set of predefined or custom rules
* Formatter
	* automatically restructure code to **adhere to a consistent style**, adjusting elements like indentation, line breaks, and spacing
### 8.3 Module Bundlers
* Module Bundler is a development tools that combine multiple JavaScript files and their dependencies into a single file, optimized for web browsers
* resolve and manage dependencies, transfom and optimize code and often support features like code splitting and lazy loading
* goal
	* stramline the development process and enhance application performance in production environments
* common module bundlers : Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Vite
	* address challenges in managing complex JavaScript applications by organizing code into modules
	* eliminating global scope pollution
	* improving load times
* support various file formats enable the use of moder JavaScript features through transpilation
* itegrate with task runners and other build tools

	>> 여러 파일(JavaScript, CSS ...)들을 하나로 결합하여 단일 파일로 만들어주는 개발 도구
	>> 장점
		- 더 작은 용량의, 더 최적화된 리소스를 제공
		- 흩어져있는 여러 파일을 하나로 통합, 문자를 압축
		- 다양한 사용자 환경에서도 돌아가도록 코드 변환
		- 안 쓰이는 소스 코드를 분석하고 제거
### 8.4 Vite
* modern build tool and development server designed for fast and lean development of web applications
* leverages native ES modules in the browser to enable near-instantaneous server start and lightning-fast hot module replacement
### 8.5 Webpack
* popular open-source JavaScript module bundler that transforms, bundles, or packages resources for the web
* key features, code splitting, lazy loading, rich ecosystem of extensions
### 8.6 Rollup
* a module bundler for JavaScript that compiles small pieces of code in larger, more complex structures
* specializes in producing smaller, more efficient bundles of ES module
### 8.7 Parcel
* a zero-configuration web app bundler that simplifies the process of building and deploying web projects
* supports  multiple programming languages

------------------------------------------
### 용도별 module bundler
- Vite : 빠른 빌드 속도
- Parcel : 복잡한 설정이 필요없는 간단한 application
- RollUp : 최소한의 서드 파티로 라이브러리 생성
- WebPack : 많은 서드 파티가 필요한 복잡한 application

### 8.8 esBuild
* a high-performance JavaScript bundler and minifier designed for speed and efficiency
* it's written in Go language
